## About ReadMe

This contains the explanation of the rough draft version of project 2.

## Scientific Question

Given the similar functions of NOP2 and NAF1 gene, what are the similarities and differences in DNA sequence between 3 species (humann, mouse, and apes) and how do their 3D protein structures compare?

## Hypothesis

If the human meditation effect genes NOP2 and NAF1 and their derived protein structures are compared to other eukaryote organisms using bioinformatics methods, then the similarities in the gene sequences and protein structures will suggest positive upregulations in meditation effect genes and their biological processes.
